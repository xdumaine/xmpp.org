<p>The JSF has 96 <a href="/members/memberlist.shtml">members</a> as of this date.
Therefore quorum is achieved.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Items Subject to a Vote</strong></p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>RESOLVED that the following Section 2.9 be added to the JSF
    Bylaws:</p>
<p><strong>Section 2.9 <u>Terms of Membership</u>.</strong> Membership in the
Corporation shall be valid for a period of one (1) year,
measured from the date of the Members' meeting at which the
member was admitted or last re-admitted. In order for an
individual's membership not to lapse after 12 months, the member
must (i) re-apply during the membership application period that
begins 12 months after the application period during which the
member last applied and (ii) be re-admitted in accordance with
the procedures defined in Section 2.1. For the purposes of
instituting this policy, members accepted in 2001 shall re-apply
in July 2003 and members accepted in 2002 shall re-apply in
October 2003; thereafter, members shall re-apply according to
the 12-month rule (e.g., members accepted in January 2003 shall
re-apply in January 2004).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RESOLVED that the following Section 8.3 be added to the JSF
    Bylaws:</p>
<p><strong>Section 8.3 <u>JSF Work Teams</u>.</strong> The Board of Directors or
the Members of the Corporation may, by resolution, establish one
or more JSF Work Teams ("Teams"). Participation in Teams shall
be limited to elected Members of the Corporation. The Board
shall approve, or the Members shall elect, the chair of each
such Team. Unless elected or appointed as an officer in
accordance with Article 6 of these Bylaws, a member of a Team
shall not be deemed an officer of the Corporation.</p>
<p>Each Team shall be responsible for the active management of one
or more projects identified by resolution of the Board or of the
Members of the Corporation as of importance to the affairs of
the Corporation, or shall act in an advisory capacity to the
Board or a Committee of the Board. The specific nature of the
Team's responsibilities shall be defined by a Team Charter,
which must be approved by the Board. The Charter shall also
define the process by which Team members shall be chosen or
approved. The chair of each Team shall be primarily responsible
for the advisory functions and work items of the Team, and the
chair shall establish rules and procedures for the day-to-day
management of the Team's activities, consistent with the Team
Charter. All Teams shall report to and be supervised by the
Board of Directors, and Team budgets must be approved by the
Board.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors or the Members of the Corporation may, by
resolution, remove a Team chair or terminate a Team at any time
for any reason. A Team shall not be considered a committee of
the Board of Directors. A Team may not have and may not exercise
any of the power and authority of the Board of Directors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RESOLVED that Section 8.2 of the JSF Bylaws be amended to read
    as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Section 8.2 <u>Jabber Interest Groups</u>.</strong> The Board of
Directors, the Jabber Council, or the Members of the Corporation
may, by resolution, establish one or more Jabber Interest Groups
("JIGs"). A JIG is an open forum in which the Jabber community
may discuss topics that are addressed officially by a JSF Work
Team or the Jabber Council. While a Work Team or the Jabber
Council may take account of JIG discussions when making
decisions related to its responsibilities, it is under no
obligation to do so, and a JIG does not act in an official
advisory capacity to a Work Team or the Council. Because a JIG
is an open forum, participation in a JIG shall not be limited to
elected Members of the Corporation, and shall be open to any
interested individual. Leadership and direction for a JIG shall
be provided by the members (and in particular by the Chair) of
the relevant JSF Work Team or the Jabber Council.</p>
<p>Unless elected or appointed as an officer in accordance with
Article 6 of these Bylaws, a member of a JIG shall not be deemed
an officer of the Corporation. Unless elected as a Member of the
Corporation in accordance with Article 2 of these Bylaws, a
member of a JIG shall not be deemed a Member of the Corporation.</p>
<p>The Board of Directors, the Jabber Council, or the Members of
the Corporation may, by resolution, terminate a JIG at any time
for any reason. A JIG shall not be considered a committee of the
Board of Directors, of the Jabber Council, or of the Members of
the Corporation. A JIG may not have and may not exercise any of
the power and authority of the Board of Directors, the Jabber
Council, an approved JSF Work Team, or the Members of the
Corporation.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>RESOLVED that Section 8.1 of the JSF Bylaws be amended to read
    as follows:</p>
<p><strong>Section 8.1 <u>Jabber Council</u>.</strong> The Corporation shall
have an advisory council ("Jabber Council") to provide technical
advice to the Corporation, to approve changes to the Jabber
protocol, and to oversee and direct the activities of certain
Jabber Interest Groups. In discharging its responsibilities, the
Jabber Council shall adhere to the policies, procedures and
standards approved by the Board of Directors.</p>
<p>The individuals on the Jabber Council shall be elected by an
affirmative vote of a majority of the Members of the Corporation
voting, at each annual meeting of the Members. The individuals
elected to the Jabber Council shall, by an affirmative majority
vote of those present and voting, appoint the chair of such
Council. All the individuals elected to participate on the
Jabber Council must be Members of the Corporation.</p>
<p>If a Council member resigns his or her membership in the
Corporation, is removed from membership in the Corporation, or
is terminated from membership in the Corporation, he or she
shall thereby relinquish all rights and responsibilities as a
member of the Council. In addition, a Council member may be
involuntarily removed from the Council by an affirmative vote of
two-thirds (2/3) of the members of the Council. The Council
shall at its discretion determine whether to fill any vacancies
on the Council caused by resignation or removal of an existing
Council member.</p>
<p>The Jabber Council shall not be considered a committee of the
Board of Directors. The Jabber Council may not have and may not
exercise any of the power and authority of the Board of
Directors. The Jabber Council shall act upon the affirmative
vote of a majority of the members of the Council voting,
although the negative vote of any one member of the Council
shall function as a veto. A quorum of the Jabber Council shall
be a majority of the members of the Council. The provisions of
these Bylaws with regard to meetings, notice, etc. that apply to
Membership meetings shall apply to the Jabber Council and
members thereof unless such provisions are inconsistent with
this Article VIII. The Jabber Council shall keep regular minutes
of its proceedings and report the same to the Board.</p>
